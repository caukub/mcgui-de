# Creative Mode {#creative-mode}
Creative mode in Minecraft is a powerful tool for building, but it can pose significant security risks on multiplayer servers if not properly managed.

## Hotbar Exploitation {#hotbar-exploit}
One of the primary dangers in Creative mode is the ability to manipulate items with dangerous NBT (Named Binary Tag) data:

1. Players in Creative can edit item NBT tags directly in their hotbar.
2. This allows for the creation of items with malicious or overpowered properties.
3. These items can potentially crash the server or give players unintended abilities when used.
4. Players can also make these items in singleplayer and snuggle them through saved hotbars to the server.

## Force OP Signs {#force-op-sign}
A serious exploit introduced in Minecraft 1.8 involves using signs in Creative mode:

1. Players in Creative can create signs with specific NBT data.
2. When placed, these signs can forcibly grant OP to the player.
3. This vulnerability has remained unpatched for over a decade and is still present in Spigot, Paper and other server forks.

## Mitigation Strategies {#mitigation}
To protect your server from Creative mode exploits:

1. Limit Creative mode access to trusted players only.
2. Use plugins that restrict NBT editing or item spawning in Creative.
4. Regularly audit player inventories, chests and placed blocks for suspicious items.
5. Keep your server software updated, as some exploits may be patched in newer versions.
